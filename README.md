# loose_bachman_grooms_jansen_2022_jpo
This "paper repository" contains the notebooks for reproducing the figures in Loose, Bachman, Grooms and Jansen (2022), submitted to JPO.

There is a separate "project repository" [here](https://github.com/NoraLoose/energy_cycles) for processing the NeverWorld2 data and computing the Bleck and Lorenz energy cycles.

Structuring the code into "project" and "paper" repositories is inspired by [this guide](https://github.com/ocean-transport/science-together).
